A china cabinet in the corner by the kitchen, maybe, and a small table by the door under the shelf that I still need to put up.

It had to be instrumental music since music with lyrics would be too distracting to complete a survey.  With this in mind, I thought about a particular progressive rock album which satisfied these concerns.
6dd32abb-3f7a-493d-a92b-3ec91793431c,Back when I was reading the instructions, I was thinking about the injured muscle on my left hip that I got while exercising about two weeks. Specifically, I was thinking how it's much better today than yesterday, so much so that I can attempt to go back to my exercise regime, but not too aggressively. Then I was thinking that I might still do some ice treatment later today and take Ibuprofen just in case the injury flares up again, but only one tablet, not the usual two. Then I went back to thinking how progressively it got better after the first few days when I didn't sleep so well because of it. And that, as always when I think about the injury, which is a few times everyday, I'm lucky that it wasn't as severe as I thought it was, meaning to go to the doctor and billed huge amounts of money. And then I thought I'd better get back to the survey.

It got halfway through the show until after the veto was won and it was obvious who was staying on the block and the target and would be kicked off at the end of the episode. My interest in the show faded and I began to worry about our being over budget for the month by $260. This isn't terrible because I could pay for it next month (as it is on the credit card) but I would prefer to take care of it this month. Then I acted on it by coming onto mturk to do a few surveys.

Even though I can take care of myself now, I felt I had a lot more security, protection and unconditional love than I do today as a married woman. I was just remembering simple things like being held by my mother or father, crawling aroud on the floor and playing with my sister, memories of grandparents at the holidays, memories of summertimes with my two cousins.

I didn't want to have to watch him until my sister woke up. I didn't even know the sister with the son had work today, so i wasn't expecting them to even be here. But i guess she does and i wonder what time she works until. I don't really want to deal with kids today so i hope she gets out of work early.

8fdda1c7-b54d-4c52-b6c7-3bc389b03fb6,I was thinking about how my husband and I have been together ten years today. We have only been married for four, but we started dating ten years ago today. I was driving my car to work and thinking about how strange it is to have been with someone for so long and how much I love him.
350938ef-79c9-43b4-a071-67d0099b3655,I was working on an mturk HIT (not yours) that required me to watch a flashing screen of words and try to recall as many of those words as possible. The flashing words went on forever, and while they were flashing, I found myself distracted and thinking about what I would cook for dinner later... what craft project I wanted to work on... what fabric I wanted to use to recover the dining chairs... how warm or cool it was outside...  Pretty much anything BUT the flashing words on the screen. 
6f078723-9968-428d-b6ff-f0c722b94670,I was thinking about visiting my parents for the holidays soon.
2bd27ca6-99aa-4c08-80d1-4f85a23bdd61,I was thinking about clothing I would like to purchase.
18b92a36-90bd-4b55-bf68-b42e67407ab8,What my husband and I wanted to eat for lunch.  We couldn't decide what to get and decided to look online to help us pick a place.
f57e1861-7199-463a-81b4-74b909536c8c,I was walking the dog on a cloudy day.  I thought about the neighbors and their annoying little dog, who they let run loose, so he comes running and barking when I start on the walk.  The neighbors aren't bad people, but I think it's disrespectful to let their dog do that, especially when he comes over and takes a dump in my yard.  As I walked, I wished the sun were shining and thought about how much more I enjoy the walks then.  I look ahead to the dry foothills and imagaine I'm walking on a deserted road, so I can let my dog run loose without bothering anyone.  And I don't have to deal with the cars and other people driving, riding, or walking.  Seems like I can never get away from people anymore.  Because even when I do go for a drive in the hills, there is always someone else up there.  I think about what it would be like to move to a smaller town, or more remote area.
afd1e40b-8835-4b9a-9610-e52ce25b305b,I was thinking about the wedding I was at yesterday. I was thinking especially about how I felt at the most awkward moments where I was talking to people I just meant. I also felt the heat wave of how hot it was.
809109d1-520f-4764-b874-b18ffe9ec931,I was doing some work online and looked over at the accordion I had just bought a couple of days ago. I've been slowly teaching myself how to play it company and I began to think to myself that I ought to allocate a bit of time tonight for practising and getting a bit more comfortable with it.  I envisioned finishing work and sitting down to play it.
41cceeba-4b70-46f3-9a49-5539f686cb9e,I really wanted to find a song I had heard on a classic radio station.  I was thinking about whether the song was sung by a man or woman, what the words were, and what the melody was.  There was a particular part of the song that I found very funny and quite creepy, which is why I wanted to find the song.
11d185e3-c843-4cb8-8613-2d4af28896c7,I was thinking about what I needed to buy at the store.  I was wondering if my mother in law needed anything from the store too.  
ca5399ef-ea92-4542-92c4-c217c91ff29d,I was thinking about my wife and her struggle to find a job.  She just recently graduated and she has had some really promising interviews.  Unfortunately none of them have resulted in jobs yet and even though it has only been a couple months she is taking the rejections hard.  She really wants to leave her current part time job to go into the field she graduated in (IT) and I know it is going to happen, she graduated at the top of her class.  Still the waiting is hard for her.  I was thinking I should do something special for her to cheer her up and get her self-confidence back but I haven't figured out what would work best yet.

e9012c3d-4751-4adc-a438-f90baa845326,I was thinking about this show I went to see last weekend with Reggie Watts. It was a free event, and I was wondering how much tickets would have cost, because my friend commented that he would have loved to have seen it but he assumed tickets were very expensive, as we were right up front.
